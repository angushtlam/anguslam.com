  <p>Trying this idea out.</p>
  <p>
    An incremental approach on identifying essentials, responsible
    consumption, and supporting manufacturers of durable goods. As an
    individual living in the twenty-first century, it's an introspective
    challenge to reconcile living in the times of the impending climate
    crisis with spillovers of attitude and luxuries from globalization
    efforts in the previous century. Sustainability is a large topic, but
    this working theory focuses on consumer goods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prevailing consumer norms generally only includes a surface-level
    analysis on the costs and utility of owning an item for an individual.
    Storage, maintenance, and the impacts on the environment from the supply
    chain are usually not first considerations while looking at the shelf or
    on shopping site.
  </p>
  <p>
    To influence positive environmental changes on the greater society,
    consumer behaviors of supporting disposable or poorly made goods have to
    change. That is not to say the responsibility to address the climate
    crisis solely fall onto the individual. Governments and corporations
    have to play a outsized role too. However, an individual can make an
    impact at a local level by becoming more sustainable in material
    consumption.
  </p>
  <p>
    Environmental sustainability on an individual level doesn't mean
    throwing out all of the single use plastic straws and replacing them
    with glass ones. Nor is it getting rid of a perfectly working 2020 Honda
    Civic with a new 2023 Tesla Model 3 for the sake of using an electric
    vehicle. That's merely another form of consumerism with some
    greenwashing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Demand drives production. Instead of assuming someone else will pick up
    the item at the right price or save it from the dumpster, continuing to
    use items until they reach the end of their lifespan is the best way to
    ensure one's demand stays close to linear of their needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, the answer to a more sustainable lifestyle is complicated. A
    one-size-fits-all approach when everyone's abilities and needs are
    different. A person's journey to become more sustainable can take many
    forms. Minimalism generally makes the ask of a reduction of material
    possessions without asking the basic question on whether said
    possessions are necessary. In extreme cases, Rob Greenfield even decided
    to dispose of their Social Security card.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not a call to action to live an extreme lifestyle or change the
    world in a snap. It's not even about giving up luxuries at all, as some
    possessions have special meaning that's worth more than its cost in
    materials. The idea is a record keeping tool and a logical framework to
    become more intentional about owning material items. It's like a
    perpetual spring cleaning, airing out the attic, or flat-laying out
    possessions. If the process brings a new revelation on one's
    relationship with material goods, then that's all the better.
  </p>
  <p>This project is inspired by:</p>

    Simultaneously, I'm trying to rewire my terminally engineer brain to
    avoid overengineering simple ideas or reinventing the wheel. To see test
    out this idea, I created this table in Notion to track the date of
    purchase and price of items I own.
  </p>
  <img src="/items_notion.jpg" width="200px" />
  <p>
    Below is a truncated version of the table. It's clearly not complete,
    but I'll continue to expand this list over time.

  <p>
    Items logged: {items.length}
    <br />
    Cost today for all items: ${costTodayTotal}
  </p>
  <table class="items-table">

        <th>Item name</th>
        <th>Categories</th>
        <th>Cost per day since ownership</th>
        <th>Days until $1/day</th>
      </tr>

    <tbody>
      {items.map((item) => (
